# Toaster
Inspired by AfterDark Flying Toasters screensaver from the 1990s

# To run the program
LOAD"TOASTER",8

# When the program starts
The user will be prompted to select between the numbers 1-8
This is the number of pixel left and the number of pixels down/2 the sprites will move.

After the number is selected a "starfield" will be generated.

Once every 1000 loops, the starfield will be regenerated.
